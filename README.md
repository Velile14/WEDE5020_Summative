# WEDE5020_Summative
This is my Web Development Summative project.

These are the things that I made throughout the development of this website:

#Part 1

I created ten  web pages with an inserted header, a header logo that is a screen reader, text and images.
The web pages are: about, adoption, contact, donate, faqs, gallery, index, news, stories, and volunteer.
The structure of web pages differ, but here are the main parts of all the web pages : head, and body (header (nav), main, footer).
The header and header logo, along with the navigation links are shared across all the web pages.
The background of the header is beige.
Every image has a figure caption beneath it.
In the "contact" html file I included a map for location.
In the footer of every web page there is a copyright with my student number.

#Part 2

I created multiple CSS files for for all the html files and a README.md file.
I change the background of the header from beige to teal, the white color background of the body to beige, as well as the text color.
In the "gallery" html file I changed the way the images were displayed and the figure caption from it being beneath the image to being beside the image.
I added a background image for the header banner.
I added mobile responsiveness, but unfortunately it is not functioning properly.

#Part 3

I resolved the mobile responsiveness issue, and it works well.
I added a Javascript file called "script.js".
Created a Hamburger menu toggle that is adjusted when using mobile responsiveness.
On the Homepage's image I used the modal interactive element, to allow the image to be clickable.
On the "gallery" webpage I centered the text, so that the text does not break when using mobile responsiveness.
I added more pictures in the "gallery" webpage.
Also on the gallery I used the modal interactive element, to create a clickable slideshow for the images.
On the "stories", "faqs", "about", and "news" webpages I used the accordion interactive element.
On the "contact" webpage I enlarged the map.
On the "volunteer", "donate", and "adopt" webpages, I created forms. 
All on the scripts of the modals, accordions, and the forms are in the JavaScript file.
